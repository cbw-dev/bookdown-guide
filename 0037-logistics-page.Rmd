# Logistics page {#logistics}

If your workshop has an in-person location, you'll need to create a travel logistics page for your participants.

**Do not link this page on your workshop website!** To prevent uninvited guests, this link is *only* sent out by email directly to participants.

## Create your logistics page {#create-logistics}

1.  Navigate to the `travel_logistics` folder you cloned as part of your [local setup](#github-folder).

2.  Make a copy of template.md named `[CODE].md` (e.g. `INR_Mon-2511.md`) in the folder for the city your workshop will be held in (e.g. `montreal`). If that folder does not exist, create it.

3.  Open the file in your editor, likely VSCode, and fill in each section. Be careful not to miss anything.

    You'll need to embed a Google Maps for your venue. To do this, find your venue on Google Maps and click Share, then Embed A Map.

    Click Copy HTML, then paste it into your logistics document.

4.  Git add, commit, and push your changes.

5.  Your workshop will be available at `bioinformaticsdotca.github.io/travel_logistics/[city]/[code]`. In the example above, the URL would be `bioinformaticsdotca.github.io/travel_logistics/montreal/INR_Mon-2511`
