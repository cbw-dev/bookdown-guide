# Resolving Merge Conflicts {#merge-cheatsheet}

::: {.callout type="yellow" title="Two Notes"}

This cheatsheet assumes that you've already set your preferred Git conflict strategy to *merge*. For instructions on that process, [look here](#merge-prefs).  

For more details on merge conflicts, see the [Merge Conflicts section](#mergeconflicts).

:::

1. Open and fix the **`.Rmd` files** (delete markers, save). **Do NOT** touch the HTML files. Git's merge markers are as follows:

    * `<<<<<<< HEAD`: Marks the beginning of *your* local changes.

    * `=======`: Separates your changes from the incoming changes.

    * `>>>>>>> a1b2...`: Marks the end of the *incoming* changes.

2. Rebuild the book

3. git add

4. git commit

5. git push
