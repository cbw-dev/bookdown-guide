# Editing Your Workshop {#editing-cheatsheet}

::: {.callout type="yellow" title="Two Notes"}

This cheatsheet assumes that you've already cloned your repo to your computer. For instructions on that process, [look here](#clone).  

For more details on how Bookdown works, see the [Bookdown Crash Course](#bookdown-crash-course).

:::

1.  Navigate to your repo using File Explorer.

2.  Open your repo in RStudio by double-clicking the .Rproj file. **Remember to always run `git pull` before making changes**. Once you've done so, make any edits you like.

3.  [Click **Build** to create the HTML files that make up the website](#finishing-touches).

4.  [**Commit and push**](#finishing-touches) to send your changes to GitHub.

5.  Your website will be ready in 1-2 minutes!



## R Markdown File

R Markdown files act as notebooks which can make it easier to document and share code. All the results from the code as well as your comments and descriptions can be combined into one, tidy document. This makes it easy to combine insights, protocols and figures in a practical and organized fashion.

## Setting up:

### Installing a package

To install a package, we simply use the function `install.packages()` with the name of the desired package in quotation marks (i.e. as a string!)

```{r}
# install.packages("packageName1")

# for multiple packages:
# install.packages(c("packageName1", "packageName2"))

```

### Loading packages

To load a package you simply use the `library()` function. Note function takes the name of an installed library without quotation marks.

```{r}

#library(packageName1)

```

## R Basics:

### Variable names

There are several naming conventions in coding: `snake_case` and `CamelCase` are the most common. There is no particular preference in R for naming, but make sure you are **consistent** and that your variable names are **meaningful**.

### Case sensitivity

R is case sensitive. This means that `var1` and `Var1` represent two different objects.

### 1 based indexing

Indexing (calling elements in a list) in R starts with 1. The first element has index 1, the second 2, etc..

```{r}
# Initialising a vector
var1 <- c('a', 'b', "c", "d") # note ' and " are the same in R :)

# Here we call elements 1 and 2 of var1
var1[1]
var1[2]

#Now we look at how long var1 is using the length() function

length(var1)

```

# Exercises

## 1. Create a file

Create a new .R script in R studio. Save it as `Script01` in the `IntroToR` folder.

## 2. Install base packages

In `Script01`, install the following packages: `"data.table"`,`"datasets"`,`"devtools"`,`"dplyr"`,`"ggplot2"`,`"plyr"`,`"medicaldata"`,`"gapminder"`,`"RColorBrewer"`,`"rmarkdown"`,`"stringr"`,`"tidyr"`,`"tidyverse"`,`"viridis"`.

## 3. Load a package

Load all packages.

# Solutions

## 1. Creating a file

## 2. Install base packages

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages(c("data.table","datasets","devtools","dplyr","ggplot2","plyr","medicaldata","gapminder","RColorBrewer","rmarkdown","stringr","tidyr","tidyverse","viridis"))
```

## 3. load packages

```{r, eval = F}
library(data.table)
library(datasets)
library(devtools)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
library(medicaldata)
library(gapminder)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rmarkdown)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
```
