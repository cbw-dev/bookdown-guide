# Callouts {#callouts}

## Basic Syntax

Callouts are created using a fenced div block starting with `::::`.

```markdown
:::: {.callout type="blue" title="My First Callout"}

This is the content of the callout. You can write any Markdown here.

::::
```

:::: {.callout type="blue" title="My First Callout"}

This is the content of the callout. You can write any Markdown here.

::::

**Important:** Always leave a **blank line** after the opening `:::: {....}` line and before the final closing `::::` line.

The content area inside a callout is standard Markdown. You can include:

-   Paragraphs and line breaks.
-   Bulleted (`-`) or numbered (`1.`) lists.
-   **Bold** and *italic* text.
-   `inline code`.
-   Fenced code blocks.
-   Links and images.
-   Even other nested callouts!

## Attribute Reference

Customize each callout by adding attributes inside the curly braces `{}`.

| Attribute | Required? | Description | Example Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `type` | **Yes** | Sets the color scheme. | `"red"`, `"blue"`, `"green"`, `"yellow"`, `"purple"`, `"orange"`, `"gray"` |
| `style` | No | Defines the visual style. | `"regular"` (default), `"important"`, `"subtle"`, `"plain"` |
| `title` | No | Text for the callout's title. Can include Markdown. | `"Important Note!"`, `"**Action Required**"` |
| `icon` | No | Controls the icon next to the title. | `"true"` (default), `"false"`, `"fas fa-rocket"` |
| `collapsible` | No | Makes the callout a dropdown. | `"true"`, `"false"` (default) |
| `center_title` | No | Centers the title (static callouts only). | `"true"`, `"false"` (default) |

## Default Icons

If you set `icon="true"` or omit the `icon` attribute, a default icon will be shown based on the `type` you've chosen. Here are the defaults:

| `type` (Color) | Default Icon | Icon Class (`fas fa-...`) |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `red` | <i class="fas fa-triangle-exclamation" style="color: #C0392B;"></i> | `triangle-exclamation` |
| `blue` | <i class="fas fa-circle-info" style="color: #2980B9;"></i> | `circle-info` |
| `green` | <i class="fas fa-circle-check" style="color: #229954;"></i> | `circle-check` |
| `yellow` | <i class="fas fa-bell" style="color: #FFC107;"></i> | `bell` |
| `purple` | <i class="fas fa-star" style="color: #8E24AA;"></i> | `star` |
| `orange` | <i class="fas fa-fire" style="color: #FB8C00;"></i> | `fire` |
| `gray` | <i class="fas fa-comment-dots" style="color: #757575;"></i> | `comment-dots` |

You can override any of these defaults by specifying a different icon class, for example: `icon="fas fa-lightbulb"`. Find more icons on the [Font Awesome website](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free&s=solid).

## Examples

Here are some practical examples you can copy and adapt.

### Example 1: Static Informational Note

A standard blue callout for providing information.

```markdown
:::: {.callout type="blue" title="Information"}

This is a standard blue informational callout.
The default icon for 'blue' will be used.

::::
```

:::: {.callout type="blue" title="Information"}

This is a standard blue informational callout.
The default icon for 'blue' will be used.

::::

### Example 2: Collapsible "Plain" Answer Box

A minimal dropdown, perfect for hiding answers to questions.

```markdown
:::: {.callout type="green" style="plain" title="What is the answer?" icon="fas fa-question-circle" collapsible="true"}

The answer is revealed here. This plain dropdown uses a green icon because we set `type="green"`.

::::
```

:::: {.callout type="green" style="plain" title="What is the answer?" icon="fas fa-question-circle" collapsible="true"}

The answer is revealed here. This plain dropdown uses a green icon because we set `type="green"`.

::::

### Example 3: Important Red Warning

A high-visibility static callout for critical information.

```markdown
:::: {.callout type="red" style="important" title="CRITICAL WARNING" icon="fas fa-triangle-exclamation"}

System integrity is compromised. Immediate action required.
Please check the `error_log.txt` file for details.

::::
```

:::: {.callout type="red" style="important" title="CRITICAL WARNING" icon="fas fa-triangle-exclamation"}

System integrity is compromised. Immediate action required.
Please check the `error_log.txt` file for details.

::::

### Example 4: Comprehensive Dropdown

This example uses multiple attributes and contains rich Markdown content, including a fenced code block. **To prevent rendering issues when nesting code blocks, use a longer fence (e.g., five colons `:::::`) for the outer callout block.**

``````markdown
:::: {.callout type="orange" style="important" title="**Action Needed**: Review Workflow" icon="fas fa-clipboard-check" collapsible="true"}

### Step 1: Data Ingestion

Please ensure your data from `source_data/experiment_A.csv` has been correctly loaded.

- Check for missing values.
- Verify data types.

### Step 2: Pre-processing

The pre-processing script `scripts/01_preprocess.R` must be run before analysis.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Example snippet from the script
# source("scripts/01_preprocess.R")
# processed_data <- preprocess_data(raw_data)
```

### Step 3: Analysis & Reporting

Confirm that the final report `output/final_report.html` has been generated.

If you encounter any issues, please refer to the *Troubleshooting Guide* section.

## Nesting Callouts

You can nest callouts inside other elements, such as lists, by indenting the entire callout block.

**To place a callout inside a list item, indent the entire `::::` block (including its opening and closing fences and all of its content) by four spaces.**

### Example of a Nested Callout

`````markdown
1.  This is the first item in the list.

2.  This is the second item, which will contain a callout.

    :::: {.callout type="blue" title="This is an indented callout"}

    This entire callout block is indented, making it part of the second list item.

    - You can have other Markdown elements inside, like this list.
    - They must also be indented to be part of the callout.

    ::::

3.  This is the third item in the list, appearing after the callout.
