# (PART) Setup and Installations {-}

# Installations {#installs}
You'll only need to run these steps once.

1.  **Download and install R** <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, version 3.6.0 or higher. Follow the instructions for your operating system (Linux/macOS/Windows).

    ***MacOS***

    Open the program Terminal (installed on Macs by default) and run the command `"R"`. An R Console should start and you should be able to start running R commands. If not, your install was unsuccessful.

    ***Windows***

    - Click the "Start" menu icon in your bottom left of your taskbar (often a window pane).
    - Click "All >" (in the top right of the popup) to see all the programs you have installed.
    - Scroll to the "R" section. If "R X.X.X" (where the Xs indicate the version installed) is present, you installed R properly! If not, your install was unsuccessful.

    **Note:** If you have not installed R properly, try deleting your previous attempt, redownloading, and reinstalling.

    **Note:** **We will not be using the R console** (which will open if you try clicking R X.X.X). We will be using RStudio instead.

2.  **Download and install RStudio** <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#:~:text=AND%20INSTALL%20R-,2%3A%20Install%20RStudio,-DOWNLOAD%20RSTUDIO%20DESKTOP" target="_blank">here</a>. Scroll down to find downloads for non-macOS.

    > Note: While installing, you may be asked whether to install the 32-bit or 62-bit RStudio version. Download the version that matches your PC.


3.  **Install Git, if you don't already have it.** Git is a tool that will help us with version control when editing your workshop. Linux and macOS computers generally have Git pre-installed. Windows computers must install Git. However, make sure to double check if you already have Git, so that you don't have to install it again! **Check if you have Git** by running this command in terminal/command prompt:

    ```{bash}
    git --version
    ```

    If your output looks like "git version X.X.X ...", you already have git. Move onto step 4.

    However, if your output says "Git is not recognized" or a similar statement (such as the one provided below), you do not have Git, so you must install it as well.

    ```         
    'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
    operable program or batch file.
    ```

    -   When you ran `git --version`, it will have prompted you to install Git. Follow these instructions.

    -   Go to the <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#:~:text=AND%20INSTALL%20R-,2%3A%20Install%20RStudio,-DOWNLOAD%20RSTUDIO%20DESKTOP" target="_blank">Git for Windows installer</a> and download Git. Then, install it with all the default settings. <br>

    Click here for instructions on <a href="https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-windows" target="_blank">**installing Git on Linux**</a>.

    :::: {.callout type="green" title="Check your Git install" collapsible="true" style="plain" icon="true"}
    
    Re-run "git --version" and check that it returns your expected version. (On Windows, this may look like "git version 2.47.1.windows.1").

    **Note:** If you installed Git while having a Command Prompt/Windows PowerShell window open, close this window and open a new one to run "git --version". This acts as a refresher to Command Prompt/Windows PowerShell.

4.  **R packages**: Open RStudio and run the following commands in the console (bottom left window): 

    -   **Bookdown**:
    
        ```r
        install.packages("bookdown")
        ```

    -   **Other packages**:

        ``` r
        install.packages(c("magrittr", "stringi", "stringr", "reticulate", "tinytex","servr", "readr"))
        ```

        You may have to approve some downloads. Say "yes" and enter your password when necessary. This tells bookdown you are okay with downloading and installing these packages in their default locations.

       - **Tinytex:**

          ``` r
          tinytex::install_tinytex()
          ```

5.  **VSCode**: For updating the homepage, you will need a different editor. We recommend VSCode, but if you have a different editor you already prefer, that will also work. [You can download Visual Studio Code here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
