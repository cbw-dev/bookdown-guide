# Finishing touches {#finishing-touches}

1.  Open the .Rproj file in the folder you've just downloaded
2.  Upload your workshop icon to the ``img/`` folder and any sponsor logos to the `img/sponsors` folder
3.  In _output.yml, replace ``missingimg.png`` with your icon's filename

    :::

4.  In the same _output.yml file, add any sponsors not already included. To do this, copy one of the existing sponsor lines and change each section. Use the `height` or `width` attributes to change how large the images are. If two images are small enough and there is no `<br>` tag in between, they will be displayed side by side like the Genome Canada and Ontario Genomics logos.

4.  Hit "Build Book" and check preview once complete. Note that you may need to adjust sizing of sponsor logos and build again.

## Oops, I Git Cloned the Wrong Repository! {#delete-git-folder-locally}

That's okay! To delete the entire local repository and the folder itself, run the following command:

```         
rm -fr folder-path
```

where "folder-path" is a file address to the repo that you want to delete. *Double check that the path is correct before running this command.*
